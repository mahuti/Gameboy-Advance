Attract Mode: Handheld/Gameboy Advance Theme
Original post: http://forum.attractmode.org/index.php?topic=1261.msg11687#msg11687

I created several themes for handhelds living in their natural environments. On desks.

### Requires: 
- Snap: video snaps from emumovies
- Flyer: 2d boxart from hyperspin
- Wheel: wheel logos from hyperspin

### Features: 
- 2d boxart is optional
- Themes are 4:3 ratio
- Does not use a spinning wheel (but does use wheel logos)
- Gameboy is based on a Gameboy with an Afterburner front light mod (hence the light bleed)


#### To-Do
- [ ] Modify Theme to work in other than 4:3 Mode
